            We prove a new quasiparticle sum expression for the character of the Ising model vertex algebra, related to the Jackson–Slater \$q\$-series identity of Rogers–Ramanujan type and to Nahm sums for the matrix \${\textbackslash}left ({\textbackslash}begin \{smallmatrix\}8\&3{\textbackslash}{\textbackslash}3\&2 {\textbackslash}end \{smallmatrix\}{\textbackslash}right ) \$. We find, as consequences, an explicit monomial basis for the Ising model and a description of its singular support. We find that the ideal sheaf of the latter, defining it as a subscheme of the arc space of its associated scheme, is finitely generated as a differential ideal. We prove three new \$q\$-series identities of the Rogers–Ramanujan–Slater type associated with the three irreducible modules of the Virasoro Lie algebra of central charge \$1/2\$. We give a combinatorial interpretation to the identity associated with the vacuum module.},
